I'll tell you a story about my first ever speech in front of almost every student
in my school. I could speak well in English because my sister used to beat me up if I made a mistake while speaking
in English. Would be ironic if I make a grammatical error here, wouldn't it? 
Anyways, So one fine day, my class teacher comes and says, "Aniket, tomorrow, it's your turn to speak in the assembly. Prepare your piece."
Oh god. The fear set in. So, I did what every 15 year-old would have done. I played football (soccer) for an hour after school
and then went home, fired up my computer to play some War Commander. War Commander had a world chat where you could talk to people 
in the sector (kind of mini servers). I had been playing it for a year and I was the youngest person in the entire sector. Everyone else
had jobs and kids and some even had grandkids. So, I was pretty pampered. Everyone loved me and I loved them back. In the game that day, I 
told about my speech the next day and how I didn't know what to do since it was my first speech. One of my friends, we'll call him Jeff, asked me
to close my game and he texted me on facebook. He sat with me for around 3 hours straight telling me about speeches and how to prepare for one. 
He even gave me pointers and helped me write it. Then he told me to read whatever I had written, record it and listen to it when I sleep. 
And that worked like a charm. I gave a phenomenal speech, impressed the girl I liked in the process and life was good again.
